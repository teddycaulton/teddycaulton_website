    <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
      I recently went through the process of converting Snowmonitor (my Streamlit app for managing Snowflake alerts) to a Snowflake Native app to allow for better integration 
      into Snowflake and posting to the Snowflake marketplace.  Snowflake currently has poor documentation for native app set up and there's a lot of missing nuance around 
      configuration setup, especially within Streamlit.  I wanted to document the process here and relevant code to save future native app developers the hassle of troubleshooting 
      the same problems I did.
     </p>
     <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
      A couple things to start:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;"> &#x2022; </a>
       <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;"> Streamlit on native apps are stuck in version 1.22, you'll probably need to rework features or revert features back to their experimental versions. </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;"> &#x2022; </a>
        <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;"> Native apps work in such a way that objects are owned by an application and actions are executed by an application role so apps are deployed into an environment completely blind.  </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;"> &#x2022; </a>
        <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;"> As such, you need to be purposeful how you grant privileges and objects to an application/application role upon setup  </a>
      </li>
      <li></li>
        <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;"> &#x2022; </a>
        <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;"> The above also means that if you have any 'use role' commands those need to be stripped out  </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
     To start, you'll want Snow CLI installed for this to make development easier, I'll leave it to you to configure and test your connection.  Once you've navigated to the directory where your project will live, execute the following:
     </p>
     <div class="box">
      <pre style = "color:#00FF00;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
<code>snow app init snowmonitor</code>
      </pre>
     </div>
     <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
      You'll be left with the following:
      </p>
      <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../images/intial_native_app.png" border="1px">
      <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
        Drop your Streamlit app inside your app folder or it won't be legible, this is what my directory looked like at the end of the port:
      </p>
      <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../images/final_native_app.png" border="1px">
      <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
      The .gitignore and READMEs are self-explanatory, I want to outline the rest of these files
      </p>

      <span style='font-weight: bold;color:#FFFFFF;font-size:175%;font-family:garamond;'>manifest.yml</span>

        A few notes:

        <li>
         <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;"> &#x2022; </a>

          <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;"> The version is mostly for metadata, you can copy what I have or read the docs and configure it after you're ready to publish  </a>

          <a style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;"> References is where you link objects in Snowflake so that you can reference them within your application.  I'll come back to this section later  </a>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
        Artifacts is where all the Streamlit magic happens, link your readme and setup_script like you can see above and make sure your default Streamlit matches whatever 
        .py file you've created for your main Streamlit app. The privileges section is where you can configure privileges that the consumer can grant through the UI.  
        You are very limited in your selection and the 6 available commands can be found below.  If you want to grant additional privileges, you'll need to have the consumer 
        create an owners rights stored procedure that your application can call to execute code as accountadmin rather than the application role.
        See the full documentation here:

          <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
            The privileges header has a limited scope of commands you can request, in my case, I needed to be able to execute, suspend and resume alerts.  There's currently no way to ask a consumer for these privileges so the only workaround is to get the user to create a owner's rights stored procedure that the streamlit app can execute.  I'll use creating execute alerts privileges as an example.  First, inside of the setup_script.sql file, add the following code to run upon initial install:          
          </p>
          <div class="box">

           This SnowSQl code creates a database for native app related transactions and creates a procedure with owner's rights that executes an alert.  Finally, it calls the register_single_reference() function defined in the setup_script.sql to add the procedure as a reference.  Back in the setup_script.sql, add the following code:          
          </p>
          <div class="box">
            <pre style = "color:#00FF00;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">

           </div>
           <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
           This is a final procedure created under the native app package that takes an alert name input and then passes it into the system reference. This then executes the alert procedure on the consumer side using owner's rights to override native app permissions.  Implementation into Python code is as easy as running the following:          
          </p>
          <div class="box">
            <pre style = "color:#00FF00;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
<code>CALL CORE.execute_alert_in_consumer_account('alert_name')</code>
            </pre>
           </div>
           <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
            This will work for any privilege provided the consumer has the rights.  Additionally, there is full transparency with the user as they only need to request a consumer run the above SnowSQL code after installation of the native app.  This allows developers to let consumers see exactly what rights they're granting to an app. 
          </p>
          <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;font-size:125%;font-family:garamond;">
            By detailing strategies to overcome limitations and optimize development processes, I've hopefully accelerated your path to building robust and scalable applications. The workarounds highlighted in this guide are designed to simplify the process of unlocking necessary privileges and configuring your environment efficiently. With these techniques at your disposal, you can avoid potential pitfalls and focus on leveraging Snowflake's capabilities to their fullest. Embracing these solutions not only enhances development speed but also empowers you to tackle complex scenarios with greater ease and confidence. As you apply these insights, you'll find that navigating Snowflake's environment becomes a more streamlined and productive experience, ultimately driving more value and innovation in your data applications.

            Snowmonitor is available as a paid application that anyone can log into and immediatly begin managing their alerts.  I'm asking for $5 a month or $50 a year but feel free to 
            message me for a free trial.
